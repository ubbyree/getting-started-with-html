<h1>Lesson 1 Notes</h1>

<b>  World Wide Web </b>

<p> WWW is short for the World Wide Web. It is also commonly reffered to as "the web".   
The web is a collection of interlinked documents contained on numerous computers across the world. 
A collection of documents on the web are refered to as a web page and are accessed by a "web browser" via the internet. 
When a web address is typed in a web browser a request is made by that computer to the server at the web address via HTTP.  
The server then locates the requested HTML document and returns it to the requesting computer. 
The HTML document is viewed via the web brower that requested the document.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b>HTML</b>

<P>HTML Stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
<br>
  <br>HTML is made up of:
  <br>Text Content (what you see)
  <br> Markup (what it looks like)
  <br>References to other documents (ex: images & videos)
  <br>Links to other pages
</P>
<br>
<br>
<b>MARKUP / TAGS & ELEMENTS</b>
<p>Markup is a code for formating the layout and style of text by the aplication of numerous <b>tags</b>.
Tags create <b>elements</b> and a collection of elements create a HTML document.
Most tags have an opeing, contents, and a closing. 
If you forget to close a tag then it will be applied to all text past it.

<br>
<br>
Some common tags are: 
<br>"b" which makes contents <b>bold</b>
<br>"em" which makes contents <em>italics</em>
<br>"a" (anchor) for making links
<br>
<br>
The exception to this rule are <B>void tags</B>.
Void tags do not contain contents so they don't require closing.
<br>
<br>Some common void tag are: 
<br>"br" which ends a line of text.
<br>"img" defines an image
</p>
<p>Some elements are <b>inline</b> and some are <b>block</b>.
  Block elements create a box that can have a width and a height.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<b>ATTRIBUTES</b>
<p>Attributes specify a value for the contents of a tag.
<br>
<br>
Some common attributes are: 
<br>"href" which is used with the anchor tag to specify the location of the created link. 
The contents of the tag will be the name of the link which will be viewable to the user.
<br>"src" is used with the img tag to specify the url of the image to be used.
